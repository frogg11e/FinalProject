	<h4>Bones or no bones?</h4>
	<p>Sharks don&apos;t have bones. Instead of bones, sharks&apos; skeletons are made from cartilage—the same soft, bendy tissue that makes up your nose and ears. This makes sharks lighter and more flexible, suited to their fast-swimming lifestyle.</p>
	&nbsp;
	<h4>Are they really smooth?</h4>
	<p>Sharks have spiky skin. Their bodies are covered in tiny, tooth-like structures called placoid scales, or dermal denticles. These scales point toward sharks&apos; tails and have an aerodynamic quality, reducing friction from the water as sharks swim. If you were to pet a shark, this is why their skin would feel like sandpaper. </p>

	<h4 mt-2>How many teeth?</h4>
	<p>Sharks have between five and 15 rows of teeth. The larger teeth grow towards the front of a shark&apos;s mouth while the smaller teeth are in the back. Over time, as sharks lose their front teeth, these smaller teeth move forward. They aren&apos;t attached to gums by roots like our teeth are, so sharks lose them often—about once per week. Some sharks have thousands of teeth—whale sharks have about 3,000. </p>

	<h4>Electric sharks?!</h4>
	<p>Sharks are capable of electroreception, meaning they can sense electric fields. Some species are so sensitive that they could pick up on a charge equivalent to that of a small battery between electrodes 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles) apart. Their electroreceptors look like jelly-filled tubes that open on the surface of sharks&apos; skin. As their prey generates electrical signals, these receptive organs help sharks hunt and even find prey that&apos;s buried in the sand. </p>
